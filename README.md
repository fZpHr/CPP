## CPP_Project

CPP_Project is a project at 42 aimed at training students in C++ programming concepts. Rather than being a fully functional application, it consists of a set of exercises and challenges designed to strengthen students' understanding of C++ language features, object-oriented programming, and data structures.

*For more information, please refer to the project's subject in the git*

## Description

The CPP_Project offers students a series of exercises to familiarize them with various aspects of C++ programming. These exercises cover topics such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and standard library usage. Students will practice implementing algorithms, designing classes, and solving problems using C++ language features.

## Objective

The main objective of CPP_Project is to provide students with practical experience in C++ programming. By working on these exercises, students gain a deeper understanding of C++ language features and develop their skills in writing efficient and maintainable code.
